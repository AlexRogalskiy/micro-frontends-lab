# app-one

Simple [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) app built with 
[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) and [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/), that uses the cute [emoji slider](https://vaadin.com/router) web component.

It is part of `micro-frontends-demo`; see the [main README](../README.md) for details about the entire project. 

## Install

First, make sure you have Node (or Yarn) installed.

Run `npm install`.
 
## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory. 

## Development server

This is only necessary if you're actually modifying the app.

If you haven't already, install the Polymer CLI: 

```
 npm install -g polymer-cli
```

Run `npm start` for the dev server. Navigate to the specified URL (for example, `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). 
This will launch index.html so you can view the app.
